 * CallyActor:

 *
 * #CallyActor implements the required ATK interfaces of [class@Clutter.Actor]
 * exposing the common elements on each actor (position, extents, etc).
 */

/*
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 *
 * ####
 *
 * Focus: clutter hasn't got the focus concept in the same way that GTK, but it
 * has a key focus managed by the stage. Basically any actor can be focused using
 * clutter_stage_set_key_focus. So, we will use this approach: all actors are
 * focusable, and we get the currently focused using clutter_stage_get_key_focus
 * This affects focus related stateset and some atk_component focus methods (like
 * grab focus).
 *
 * In the same way, we will manage the focus state change management
 * on the cally-stage object. The reason is avoid missing a focus
 * state change event if the object is focused just before the
 * accessibility object being created.
 *
 * #AtkAction implementation: on previous releases ClutterActor added
 * the actions "press", "release" and "click", as at that time some
 * general-purpose actors like textures were directly used as buttons.
 *
 * But now, new toolkits appeared, providing high-level widgets, like
 * buttons. So in this environment, it doesn't make sense to keep
 * adding them as default.
 *
 * Anyway, current implementation of AtkAction is done at CallyActor
 * providing methods to add and remove actions. This is based on the
 * one used at gailcell, and proposed as a change on #AtkAction
 * interface:
 *
 *  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649804
