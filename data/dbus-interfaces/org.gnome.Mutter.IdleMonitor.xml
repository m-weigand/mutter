      org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor:
      @short_description: idle monitor interface

      This interface is used by gnome-desktop to implement
      user activity monitoring.
  -->

  <interface name="org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor">
    <method name="GetIdletime">
      <arg name="idletime" direction="out" type="t"/>
    </method>

    <!--
        AddIdleWatch:
        @interval: Interval, in milliseconds
        @id: Watch ID, guaranteed to be greater than zero

        Add a new idle watch for a specific idle time. When the user has been
        idle for @interval milliseconds in a row, #org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor.WatchFired
        will be emitted with the returned watch @id.

        The watch will continue emitting the signal every time the
        idle time condition is reached until it is removed.

        The returned @id can be used to remove the watch by calling
        #org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor.RemoveWatch.
    -->
    <method name="AddIdleWatch">
      <arg name="interval" direction="in" type="t" />
      <arg name="id" direction="out" type="u" />
    </method>

    <!--
        AddUserActiveWatch:
        @id: Watch ID, guaranteed to be greater than zero

        Add a new active watch. When the user has been idle and becomes
        active again, #org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor.WatchFired will be
        emitted with the returned watch @id, and the watch will be removed.

        Unlike idle watches, an active watch is fired only once.

        The returned @id can be used to remove the watch (before itâ€™s fired)
        by calling #org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor.RemoveWatch.
